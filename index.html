    <h3>CAMPUS IS CALLING... ARE YOU READY TO RETURN?</h3>
    <h3>WE ARE READY FOR YOU! </h3>
    <p>
        At UAT, we’ve been working hard to prepare our campus to reopen as safely as possible. With a few Jedi tricks and a lot of preparation from our staff, we are ready to welcome you back. Here are some helpful guides to review as you're making your preparations to return to campus. May the force—and your mask—be with you.<br>
        <br>
        UPDATE 10/09/2020: With respect to scheduling and social distancing guidelines, some UAT classes will return to live (in-person) instruction on Wednesday, October 28. As stated previously, a virtual component will remain for every class, regardless of modality. Most classes will have a reduced in-person capacity. As the 28th approaches, please check your UAT email and keep an eye out for Canvas announcements regarding your in-person attendance options and how to sign up.
